## This is our first homework file! Here we're going to blend a whole bunch of stuff we've learned so far 

## Assignment 1 - pull in data
# we've talked about local data (from a file) and data preloaded into R or a package, load in some data

## Assignment 2 - print the column names and look at the types of data 

## Assignment 3 - take a few variables and create a SCATTER PLOT, HISTOGRAM, and BAR GRAPH (I suggest using ggplot2)

## Tell me why you used the variables you did for each plot type.
